# 3D-UNet-PyTorch-Implementation
This is the implementation of 3D UNet Proposed by Özgün Çiçek et al., for details please refer to: [3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric Segmentation from Sparse Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650).

Dataset used: [Soft-tissue-Sarcoma](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Soft-tissue-Sarcoma), the dataset I used has been processed by other people and due to some reasons I cannot share it here. If you want to use it for you work, please refer to the MATLAB code provided and convert the images into proper format for further processing and analysis.

# Description
Here describes the function of each file and folder

# Training results
Here shows the training results including training loss and mIOU.

**Note: Due to the limited hardward resources, the code are not yet successfuuly tested. WIP (BUSY recently, the code might be updated a litttle bit late. BUT, I am working on it constantly).**

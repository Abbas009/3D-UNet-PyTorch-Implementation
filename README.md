# 3D-UNet-PyTorch-Implementation
This is the implementation of 3D UNet Proposed by Özgün Çiçek et al., for details please refer to: [3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric Segmentation from Sparse Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650).

Dataset used: [Soft-tissue-Sarcoma](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Soft-tissue-Sarcoma), the dataset I used has been processed by other people and due to some reasons I cannot share it here. If you want to use it for you work, please refer to code provied it mentioned and convert the images into proper format for further processing.

# Description
Here describes the function of each file and folder

# Training results
Here shows the training results including training loss and mIOU.

**Note: Due to the limited hardward resources, the code are not yet successfuuly tested. WIP.**
